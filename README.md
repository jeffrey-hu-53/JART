## What is Jart?
JART is a platform in which users can play a creative game in which they can collaborate with others in making comic strips or writing stories.  In our web application, users will be able to join communities of people who have similar interests and play a live game with 1-4 other users in which each person will take a turn in making their own panel. The current player has a time limit in which they must complete their panel before their turn is over. The next person to go will pick up from what the last person created and make their own panel. This game continues on until everyone has gone 3 turns. Once this game is finished, the creators of the comic strip or story have the option to post their work for other people to see. Once posted, users can like, dislike, and comment to interact with it and provide feedback.   Our website is a great way for users to be creative with their comic making ability and express themselves within a certain amount of time.

## Why did we make JART?
Most of the time, when you think about comics or stories you think of one author creating each panel in a continuous flow. Our new form of comics and stories introduce multiple authors creating their own panel in a continuous flow. We have noticed that in other comic or story making websites such as Canva or Pixton, there is no way for users to work together. Our web application will be built with collaboration in mind and thus it is not like any other comic making website. There is also a need for artists, comic enthusiasts, and people who simply enjoy having fun to express themselves with the use of comics and stories.

## Project Implementation
With our ample planning stages we were able to design our code with a well-defined structure in mind. <br>
We used libraries such as Konva, Cloudinary, Quill, and Socket.io. <br>
Our project was built with the MERN stack design. (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) <br>
We deployed both the front and back end on Heroku and our database is hosted on MongoDB. <br>
